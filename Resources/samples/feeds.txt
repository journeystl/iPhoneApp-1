Hi Aaron,

That is great news! Well done. Here are some notes, thoughts, and
answers to your requests:

Blog Feed. The blog feed is below. It's the generic feed from the
front page. If you need something special, just let me know. (We are
building something special for the A29 app because theirs stops
printing our blog when it encounters HTML mark up!!!)

Calendar Feed(s). We are still working on where we want this to live.
Right now all the campuses have a Google Calendar that is displaying
on the website. However, we'd really like to transition to The City's
feed at some point. I'll post both sets of links below so you can let
me know if anything won't work. We need to solve this problem in
general for the desktop and mobile so you'll be hearing more soon.

Sermon Feed. Below is an RSS link that I created to drive the sermons
on the A29 app. The link below interacts with two other feeds so we
have three feeds total: All Series, Single Series, Single Sermon. I've
also used image cache settings to build images for their app. If
something like this would help you, let me know.

Let me know if how we can help and I'll try to be very responsive
throughout this process. Thanks for your leadership and work.

Hi Aaron,

Re: Blog Feed - Right now I have it limited to 15 entries. We are
still trying to get people to post more often. In short, if the
technology works, we should be good once we get our staff blogging
regularly.

Re: Cal Feeds - Listing each campus is great. I tried the same thing
for our A29 app, however, the "Church App's" (shell we are using) XML
spec is proprietary. Since I have to create a layer of abstraction, it
may as well do something intelligent. Long term, I'm looking at using
a project called Managing News. It's an RSS aggregator built on Drupal
core. I've also attached the conceptual view of this in a PDF.

Re: App Interface - We can help you style whatever. I can download the
SDK and help with design stuff.

Re: Website UI - We are aware of several places on the website that
suck. Our current "web" priorities are as follows:

1. Backend blogging workflow (get people blogging)
2. A29 iPhone app
3. Front page & ticker revamp
4. Sermon series (Media Collection content type) landing pages

The more specific feedback you can give us, the better and we can add
it to the list.

We're excited about all the moment. It's great to have you in the loop!
